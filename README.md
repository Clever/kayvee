Kayvee translates an object into a human and machine parseable string, with a "key=val" format.

## Tests

The `tests.json` file is a specification for the methods supported by kayvee.

The `version` tag is used to track when this specification is modified, particularly notable if there are any breaking changes. It follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

Each test includes:

- `title` - describes what the test covers
- `input` - arguments to pass to the tested method
- `output` - expected output string, given above input
